# **COex Backend Test Day**
Objectives:
- [X] Create an application in Django using any packages/libraries
- [X] version all source code using GIT
- [X] design a database model to store the imported data in the next step
- [X] Let the categories (Category column) be implemented as a linked model
- [X] create a management command to import data from the supplied file
- [X] create output/listing of internal IDs and names of all locations using
    - [X] a) REST endpoint (preferred - ideally DRF and JSON format)
    - [X] b) Django Views
- [ ] add filtering to the page/endpoint by category and whether the location is available with a dog
- [X] create a page/endpoint to display complete data for one location
- [X] create a way to add comments to each location
- [ ] create a page with the statistics of the places that are stored in the DB
    - Number of places
    - an overview of the categories and the number of sites in each category
    - the site with the most comments
    - farthest place from the centre of the country
    - number/estimate of English places
- [ ] on the page/endpoint listing all places, add the current temperature for each place in degrees Celsius (use API from https://open-meteo.com/ for example)
    - the page should have a mechanism/cache that will query the data only 1 per hour (preventing repeated requests that return the same value)
